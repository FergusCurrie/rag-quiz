      "    created : q=What is dependency injection in the context of software development?, a=Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally, promoting loose coupling and enhancing testability.\n",
      "    created : q=What are the main benefits of using dependency injection?, a=The main benefits include improved code modularity, easier unit testing, enhanced maintainability, and reduced dependency management complexity.\n",
      "    created : q=Can you name and briefly describe the three common types of dependency injection?, a=The three common types are: Constructor Injection (dependencies are provided through class constructors), Setter Injection (dependencies are set via public setters or methods), and Interface Injection (the dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client that passes itself to the method).\n",
      "    created : q=How does dependency injection affect unit testing of a class?, a=Dependency injection simplifies unit testing by allowing mock or stub implementations of dependencies to be injected, enabling isolated testing of the class without relying on actual implementations.\n",
      "    created : q=What is the difference between dependency injection and service locator patterns?, a=Dependency injection involves providing dependencies to a class directly, promoting clear relationships, while the service locator pattern requires the class to request its dependencies from a central registry, which can lead to tighter coupling and less clarity about the class dependencies.\n",

      "    created : q=What is model quantisation in the context of machine learning?, a=Model quantisation is the process of reducing the number of bits that represent a model’s parameters, often to improve efficiency in terms of computation and storage without significantly affecting the model's performance.\n",
      "    created : q=How does quantisation typically affect the inference speed of a neural network?, a=Quantisation can significantly increase the inference speed of a neural network, as using lower precision computations (like 8-bit integers instead of 32-bit floats) allows for faster arithmetic operations and reduced memory bandwidth requirements.\n",
      "    created : q=What are the two main types of quantisation techniques commonly used?, a=The two main types of quantisation techniques are weight quantisation, which reduces the precision of the model's weights, and activation quantisation, which reduces the precision of the intermediate activations during inference.\n",
      "    created : q=What is the trade-off involved in model quantisation?, a=The trade-off involved in model quantisation is between model size and accuracy; while reducing the precision of parameters can lead to smaller models and faster inference times, it may also result in a loss of accuracy or performance if not done carefully.\n",
      "    created : q=Which techniques can be employed to mitigate accuracy loss during quantisation?, a=Techniques such as post-training quantisation, quantisation-aware training, and parameter sharing can be employed to mitigate accuracy loss during the quantisation process, ensuring that the model maintains its performance despite reduced precision.\n",

      "    created : q=What is dynamic programming and how does it differ from other algorithm techniques?, a=Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It differs from other techniques like divide and conquer, which does not store intermediate results.\n",
      "    created : q=What are the two main properties that a problem must have for dynamic programming to be applicable?, a=The two main properties are optimal substructure, meaning the optimal solution to the problem can be composed of optimal solutions to its subproblems; and overlapping subproblems, which means that the problem can be broken down into subproblems that are reused multiple times.\n",
      "    created : q=Can you give an example of a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming?, a=The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example where dynamic programming can be applied; it can be computed using an iterative approach by storing previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.\n",
      "    created : q=What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up approaches in dynamic programming?, a=The top-down approach uses recursion and memoization to store results of subproblems as they are computed. In contrast, the bottom-up approach systematically solves all subproblems starting from the smallest and builds up to the final solution, typically using iteration.\n",
      "    created : q=What is the significance of polynomial time complexity in dynamic programming algorithms?, a=Dynamic programming algorithms often achieve polynomial time complexity by reusing computed solutions for overlapping subproblems, making them more efficient than naïve recursive approaches that may have exponential time complexity.\n",

      "    created : q=In which data structure is the Depth First Search algorithm typically implemented?, a=Depth First Search is typically implemented using a stack data structure, either explicitly or through the function call stack in a recursive implementation.\n",
      "    created : q=How does the time complexity of Depth First Search compare with the breadth-first search?, a=The time complexity of Depth First Search is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph, which is the same as the time complexity of Breadth First Search.\n",
      "    created : q=Can Depth First Search be used to find all paths in a graph? Explain briefly how., a=Yes, Depth First Search can be used to find all paths in a graph by recursively exploring all possible paths from a starting node to a target node, keeping track of the visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n",
      "    created : q=What are some common applications of Depth First Search?, a=Some common applications of Depth First Search include pathfinding algorithms, topological sorting, solving puzzles with a single solution like mazes, and searching in artificial intelligence for state space exploration.\n",

      "    created : q=What is a B-tree, and how does it differ from a binary tree?, a=A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. Unlike a binary tree, where each node has at most two children, a B-tree node can have multiple children, facilitating more efficient data storage and retrieval, especially in database systems.\n",
      "    created : q=What is the main advantage of using B-trees in file systems?, a=The main advantage of using B-trees in file systems is their ability to maintain balance and keep data sorted in a way that optimizes the number of disk accesses required for read/write operations, making them particularly efficient for handling large amounts of data stored on disk.\n",
      "    created : q=Describe the insertion process in a B-tree when a node overflows., a=When a node in a B-tree overflows after an insertion (i.e., it exceeds its maximum allowed number of children), the node is split into two nodes. The median key of the original node is promoted to the parent node, and this process may recursively continue up the tree if the parent node also overflows.\n",
      "    created : q=What role does the order of a B-tree play in its structure and performance?, a=The order of a B-tree determines the maximum number of children each node can have, which impacts its height and the number of I/O operations required for search, insertion, and deletion. A higher-order B-tree generally leads to a shorter height, allowing for faster operations due to the reduced number of nodes that must be traversed.\n",
      "    created : q=Can B-trees be used for both static and dynamic datasets? Explain your answer., a=Yes, B-trees can be used for both static and dynamic datasets. They are particularly well-suited for dynamic datasets due to their efficient insertion and deletion operations, which maintain balance and order. However, they can also handle static datasets where the data does not change over time, benefiting from their fast search capabilities.\n",

      "    created : q=Why are red-black trees considered balanced binary search trees?, a=Red-black trees maintain balance by ensuring that the longest path from the root to the leaves is no more than twice the length of the shortest path. This balance allows operations such as insertions, deletions, and lookups to have a time complexity of O(log n).\n",
      "    created : q=How does the insertion process work in a red-black tree?, a=During insertion, the new node is initially added as a red node to maintain the binary search tree property. If this creates a violation of red-black properties, a series of rotations and color swaps may be performed to restore the properties.\n",
      "    created : q=What is the purpose of the rotation operations in red-black trees?, a=Rotations in red-black trees (left or right) are used to maintain tree balance and satisfy the red-black properties after insertions or deletions, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and the search operation remains efficient.\n",
      "    created : q=What happens to the red-black tree properties after a deletion?, a=After a deletion, the tree may violate red-black properties, particularly if it removes black nodes. To restore these properties, the tree may undergo recoloring and rotations to ensure every path from the root to the leaves has the same number of black nodes while also maintaining the other red-black properties.\n",
